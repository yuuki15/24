# 24

A Perl script to list "distinct" solutions to the [24 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle))

## History

* -2013
    * I learned about the 10 puzzle (a variation popular in Japan).
* Aug 2018
    * I published an [article](http://archive.today/2018.08.25-001836/http://konno.co.nf/%E3%83%86%E3%83%B3%E3%83%91%E3%82%BA%E3%83%AB) (in Japanese) on a naive solver in Ruby.
* Jul 2022
    * I realized that eliminating duplicate solutions could not be done with a CAS such as SymPy and started my research.
* Sep 2022
    * My research was completed, except for the 0 puzzle.
* Jan 2023
    * I abandoned the research and uploaded the results to [24-puzzle-solver/24-puzzle-solver](https://github.com/24-puzzle-solver/24-puzzle-solver).
* Feb 2024
    * I reorganized the earlier results in this repo, essentially unchanged.
